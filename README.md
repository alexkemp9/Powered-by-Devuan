# Powered-by-Devuan
A Series of Logos + the IM6 Scripts to Create Them

This is a series of *“Powered by Devuan”* logos for use in websites, wherever. There's not a lot, but an ImageMagick (IM6) script is provided for each option, and that means that you can spend the next 3 months customising the crap out of them.

## *The Logos*

Here is a set of six ( {LHS | Centre | RHS} top + bottom ) each in *“NimbusSans-Regular”* font:–     

![lhs logo](Logo/devuan-powered-by-lhs.png) | ![centre logo](Logo/devuan-powered-by-centred.png) | ![rhs logo](Logo/devuan-powered-by-rhs.png)
![lhs-bottom logo](Logo/devuan-powered-by-lhs-bottom.png) | ![centre-bottom logo](Logo/devuan-powered-by-centred-bottom.png) | ![rhs-bottom logo](Logo/devuan-powered-by-rhs-bottom.png)

…and then, just because we can, here is the same set of 6 but with a *narrow* version of the same font:–     

![lhs logo](Logo/devuan-powered-by-lhs-narrow.png) | ![centre logo](Logo/devuan-powered-by-centred-narrow.png) | ![rhs logo](Logo/devuan-powered-by-rhs-narrow.png)
![lhs-bottom logo](Logo/devuan-powered-by-lhs-bottom-narrow.png) | ![centre-bottom logo](Logo/devuan-powered-by-lhs-bottom-narrow.png) | ![rhs-bottom logo](Logo/devuan-powered-by-rhs-bottom-narrow.png)

## *The Scripts*

This is the combo of IM Script + the PNG that that script will produce (in the same order as above):

convert-lhs ＝＞ devuan-powered-by-lhs.png | convert-centred ＝＞ devuan-powered-by-centred.png | convert-rhs ＝＞ devuan-powered-by-rhs.png
convert-lhs-bottom ＝＞ devuan-powered-by-lhs-bottom.png
